00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.870

- He respects you. - Way too late.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.790

在北约特遣部队的帮助下 摧毁了他的制造工厂

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.660
在那之后格拉多夫就消失了

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.330
西班牙这次行动 是我们这两年首次有机会逮捕他

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.870
我们应该提醒克拉克的团队 注意杰克戈登这个人

Jack always goes for the jugular,

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.080

你跟总统的通讯主管说了
Did you tell the president's comms director

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.120
让他按剧本表演吗
that he must stick to the script?

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.040
说了
Yes.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.200
很好 希望他别提无法满足的要求

他到现在都还分不清 新闻发布会和媒体宣传会的区别
He still hasn't figured out the difference between a press conference and a press junket.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.410

“二重唱”
Duet?

对 就好比我是德瑞博士 而你是阿姆
Yeah. It's like I'm Dr. Dre and you're Eminem,

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.410
这是我们第一次同台演出
and we're taking that stage for the first time together.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:38.450

我们就避而不谈 把皮球踢给别人
I'd just steer clear of it. Let's just punt it.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.330
-“踢给别人”  - 没错

能源安全就是国家安全

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.200
它也是对创造就业的投资
It is also an investment in job creation.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.910
能提供很多工作机会
A whole lot of jobs.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.200

你会去客串吗
Any chance you'll be making a cameo?

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:03.240
各位 我答应过第一夫人 如果我再穿“单宁毒液”的装扮
Oh, folks. I promised the first lady if I ever dressed up as the Venom in Denim again,

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.290
那肯定是在椭圆办公室 或者是为了白宫记者晚宴
it'd either be in the Oval boudoir or for the White House Correspondents' Dinner,

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.410
你只能受邀参加晚宴 椭圆办公室可去不了
and you're only invited to the last one.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.410
- 克拉克首相 - 请提问

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.990
- 好吧 谁有真正的问题  - 等一下
- Okay. Who has a real question? - Hey, hold on a minute.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.200
还有谁不想让首相继续打光棍了
Now, who else is tired of seeing the prime minister as a single man?

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.870
我们给他定制一季《单身汉》吧
I'll tell you what. How about we get him his own season of The Bachelor?

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.000
- 还有谁想加入  - 好啊 搞起来

您能否就抓捕 著名军火商维克托格拉多夫的
Can you comment on speculation this is the result

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.750
秘密行动失败的猜测发表评论
of a failed covert operation to capture known arms dealer Viktor Gradov?

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.740
秘密行动之所以是秘密 是有原因的
Covert operations are covert for a reason.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.700
其他的无可奉告
That's all I'm gonna say on that.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.330
不仅如此 格拉多夫会后悔 昨天没有束手就擒
That and Gradov's gonna wish we caught him yesterday.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.410
因为当我们抓到他的时候
Because when we do get our hands on him,

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.740
他就会知道复仇
he is going to be forming a special relationship

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.990
到底是什么滋味
with the concept of retribution.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.200
我们还应将此 作为一个集体反思的时刻
We should also be using this as a collective moment of introspection,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.040
找出哪里出了问题 并从中吸取教训

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.990
监控着我们所有的邮件 视频会议
which monitors all of our emails, video conferences,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.700
- 还有电话... - 汤姆
- phone calls... - Tom.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.740
我不能一直说“无可奉告”
There's only so many times I can say "no comment" to that.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.990
所以我来回答
I'll comment.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.200
我们的敌人应该感到害怕
Our enemies should be afraid.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.540

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:31.990
没错
Well, we are.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.870
美利坚合众国在此承诺 一定会取得成果
The United States of America is promising results.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.700
德林杰总统 你有什么话要对
President Derringer,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.450
在西班牙遇害者的家人们说吗
do you have a message for the families of the men and women killed in Spain?

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.160
我在特种部队待过很长时间
I've spent a lot of time with Special Forces.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.240
和他们一起训练
Trained with them,

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.410
从他们身上学习

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.450
我要说的是 我们必须做得更好 我们也一定能做得更好
And what I have to say is we must do better. We will do better.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:53.790
当你说“和他们一起训练” 是指为了电影角色训练吧
When you say, um, "trained with them," that was for an acting role, yes?

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.790
- 是的 但是... - 我是说 你从来没服过役
- Yes, but, uh... - I mean, y-you've never served.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.620
作为一个在英国军队服役的人 你们都知道
As someone who did serve in the British Army, as most of you know,

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.040
如果我对家属有话要说
if I did have something to say to the families,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.910
我会当面跟他们说 而不会通过你向英雄致敬 杰克
I would say it to them directly. I do not salute heroes through you, Jack.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.870
说实话 你没上过战场
To be clear, you never saw combat.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.080
恕我直言 先生们 你们是政客
But with all due respect, gentlemen, you're politicians.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.790
你们不会真把自己当成真英雄了吧
You don't equate yourselves with actual heroes, do you?

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.620
真是糟透了
Well, that was a shit-bath.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.370
社交媒体上热议不断 #指挥官之争 正登上热搜
Socials are lighting up. Hashtag "commanders in beef" is trending.

你很清楚杰克戈登是个麻烦 我警告过你的
You knew Jack Gordon was trouble. I warned you.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.790

My town. I'll call on whomever I want.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:35.500
休息五分钟
Let's take five.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.910
我可不怕媒体
You know, I'm not afraid of the press.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.990
不是每个人都需要被所有人喜欢
Not all of us have a compulsive need to be liked by everyone.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.490
恕我直言...
With all due respect...

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.790
我知道你乐于替他出头
I know you like to fight his battles for him, Simone.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.870

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.200
- 我干这行已经六年了 - 你 我能替自己出头
- I've been on this slog for six years. - You? I fight my own battles.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.160
要不拿数据说话 要不先从
You, you want to talk numbers?

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.790
你的支持率开始说起
Your approval ratings, that's a great place to start.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.160
不像你 我要的是结果 而不是别人在Ins上给我点赞
Unlike you, I'll take results over likes on Instagram.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.120
你都不在乎别人怎么想 你还要求大家集体反思一下
You-you clearly don't care about what people think. You called for a collective moment of introspection?

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.290
这么说吧 我更关心 民众如何还得起抵押贷款
Let's just say I'm more concerned with how people pay their mortgages

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.990
如何送孩子上大学
and send their kids to university.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.910
是啊 公众最爱看 政客们给他们布置“家庭作业”了
Oh, for sure, 'cause God knows there's nothing the public loves more than politicians giving them homework.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.160
你是在为炸鱼薯条那事生气吗  如果是的话就直说吧
Is this about the fish and chips thing? 'Cause if it is, just say it.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.370
我一点也没为这破事生气
I am not mad about the goddamn fish and chips thing.

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.830
够了 你们俩今天都表现得不怎么样
Enough. Neither of you were at your best today.

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.790
同意 我们得尽快解决这事
Agreed. We need to give this a short shelf life.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.910
他说得对 改变说话方式
He's right. Change the narrative.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.620
把这变成一个机会...
Turn this into an opportunity.

不用 我不坐 感谢你的好意
No, I'm good, thank you very much.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.410
- 而且我今晚必须去华沙 - 不 听我说完
- And besides, I have to be in Warsaw tonight. - Hear me out, all right?

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.540
你们俩在伦敦的飞机舷梯上停留35秒 挥手微笑
You both do 35 seconds on the airstairs here in London, waving and smiling,

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.040
在华沙短暂停留下 你们早餐前就能到达得里雅斯特

我是美国总统 我不和任何人共用舞台
I am the President of the United States. I don't share the stage with anyone.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.490
搭便车 这就是你的解决方案
Hitch a ride? Is that your solution?

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.620
这样民意调查中的支持率 必将提升三个百分点
It's a guaranteed three-point bump in the polls.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.950
听着 我们的任期刚开始
Look, we are in the early days.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.080
你得证明你能交到朋友
You've got to show you can make friends.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.450
眼下 我们更需要他 而非他需要我们
Right now we need him more than he needs us.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.660
萨姆 为了胜利
Sam, take the win.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:24.830

我跟先遣队一起

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.290

Mr. Prime Minister.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.160
能否请你赏脸 和我一起乘坐空军一号
Would you do me the honor and fly with me aboard Air Force One?

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.040
说实话...
I'll be honest.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.580
我整晚睡不着在想
It kept me up all night.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.540
为什么我花重金 请来最顶尖的狙击手
How is it that I hire the best sniper money can buy

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.410
结果他偏偏在关键时刻失手了
and he misses the one shot meant to protect

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.490
没能护住我整个行动中最重要的人
the most important man in my entire operation?

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.490
好吧 谢谢 但我们都在尽自己的职责
Yeah, thanks, but we're all just doing our part.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.000
都是拼图的碎片 被子上的补丁
Pieces of a puzzle, patches on a quilt...

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.830
我先以为是设备故障
I assumed it was faulty equipment.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.830
现在我知道了 是人为失误
But now I know it was human error.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.620
就像你说的...
Like you say...

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.540
“发生的一切都是最好的安排”
"Everything that happens happens for the best."

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.120
是啊
Yes.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.580
来吧
Come.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.080
坐
Sit down.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.000
我妈妈很喜欢这句话
My mother was very fond of that phrase.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.490
她是个格达尔卡 算命的
She was a gadalka. A fortune teller.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.040
她会看茶叶
She read tea leaves.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:54.450
她能看到未来
She could see the future.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.830
她看到了我的未来 说有一天
She saw mine and said that one day

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.870
我会受到非常不公正的待遇
I would be served a great injustice,

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.870
我人生的目标 就是让那些责任人付出代价
and it would be my mission in life to punish those responsible.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.830
没有任何事 任何人
And nothing or no one

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.910
能阻止我
would get in my way.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.740
十多年来 美国总统首次...
It's been over a decade since a U.S. president

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.700
...在空军一号上接待英国首相
has hosted a British prime minister on Air Force One,

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.040
这次访问必将载入史册
making this trip one for the history books.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.580
瞧瞧啊
Check her out.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.080
刚下生产线
Fresh off the assembly line.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.290
这款飞机的翼展 比前代型号宽了30英尺
30-foot wider wingspan than the previous model.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.620
速度可以突破音速 转弯时像F-15战斗机一样灵活
Can break Mach 1, oh, and corners like an F-15.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.830
很惊讶你没有在它侧面画火焰
Surprised you didn't paint flames on the side of it.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.700
你这是在嫉妒 你的飞机很烂 而且名字也不酷
Ah, you're just jealous 'cause your plane sucks and doesn't have a cool name.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.700
伙计们
Fellas.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.040
我们爱威廉
We love Will! We love Will!

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.290
首相先生
Mr. Prime Minister.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.660
我听说你喜欢黑麦威士忌
I heard you like rye.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.870
这款酒来自我的家乡肯塔基
This one comes from my hometown in Kentucky.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.410
这就是美国独特性与优越性的体现
Now, that is American exceptionalism in action.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:38.290
谢谢
Thank you.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.660
请慢用 先生
Enjoy, sir.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.000
他在这呢 来这边
There he is. Come on.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.540
跟克拉克首相打个招呼
Say hello to Prime Minister Clarke. Hey.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.950
对他好点 他最喜欢哈里斯泰尔斯了
Be nice to him, Sawyer. He's besties with Harry Styles.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.370
我不太确定 但如果他下次去华盛顿
Well, I don't know about that, but next time he's in Washington,

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.120
我看看能不能给你弄到个好座位
I'll see if I can get you some good seats.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.330
- 谢谢 - 谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.620
很高兴终于见到你 首相先生
Nice to finally meet you, Mr. Prime Minister.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.370
不必 说实话 叫我萨姆就好
Now, honestly, just-just call me Sam.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.330
很遗憾这次没能见面
I'm so sorry we missed each other.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.290
你们俩照顾好自己 对他好一点 萨姆
You two take care of yourselves, and go easy on him, Sam.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.080
我们还在学习
We're still learning the ropes.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.910
- 我会尽量让他远离麻烦 - 好了 嘿
- I'll try and keep him out of trouble. - Okay, hey.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.830
爱你们 明天再聊
Love you guys. Talk to you tomorrow.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.750
你很擅长这个
You're good at that.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.950
擅长什么
Good at what?

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.490
做正常人...
Being normal. Ish.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.040
- 接近正常 - 我该说谢谢
Uh, thank you?

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.910
你应该更经常地 向人们展示你的这一面
You should show people that side of you more often.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.620
第一步是结束单身
Start by ditching the bachelor status.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.620
世界领导人如果未婚会让人不安
World leader who's unmarried?

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.290
留给人们太多想象空间
Freaks people out, leaves too much to the imagination.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:54.790
他们会想象什么
What are they imagining?

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.740
我不确定 类似《大开眼戒》里那种派对
I don't know, Eyes Wide Shut parties

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.990
或者到了晚上你就成了蒙面义警 做一些奇怪的 令人不安的事
or by night you're some masked vigilante into some weird, unsettling shit.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.450
听着 人们想要的是确切性
Look, people want clarity.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.990
婚姻能提供一种确切性 能让你的形象显得更亲切
Marriage gives them clarity. It softens the image.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.160
我搞糊涂了 你是在给我建议
I'm confused. Are you giving me advice

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.120
还是在向我推荐你的烂情景喜剧
or are you pitching me on one of your shit rom-coms?

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.290
我懂 你不喜欢我的电影
All right, I get it. You don't like my movies.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.990
我从没看过你的电影
I've never seen your movies.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.910
因为萨姆克拉克不喜欢娱乐
Because Sam Clarke is the man who does not like to be entertained.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.830
不 是因为我喜欢真正的电影
No, it's 'cause I like actual cinema.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.080
拜托 难道是我不想 和韦斯安德森或奉俊昊合作吗
Come on. You don't think I wanted to work with Wes Anderson or Bong Joon Ho?

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.580
我当然想
Of course I do.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.910
我受过正统训练
I'm classically trained.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.910
你知道我和爱德华诺顿演过戏吗
Did you know I once did a play with Edward Norton?

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.120
但老天爷一直说我拿枪会很帅
But the universe keeps telling me I look cool with a gun in my hand.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.000
玩具枪
A toy gun.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.500
你是怎么回事
What is it with you?

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.240
一天到晚觉得自己比别人都强
Walking around, thinking you're better than everybody else.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.370
一开始我以为是英国人都这样 现在我明白了 只有你这样
First, thought it was a British thing. Then I realized it's a you thing.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.660
我认识保罗麦卡特尼 好吗
I know Paul McCartney, okay?

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.660
他比你受欢迎多了
He's put a whole lot more wins on the board than you,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.200
而且他酷毙了
and he is cool as shit!

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.450
- 要我送过去吗  - 我送就行 谢谢
- Want me to take it up? - I got it. Thanks.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.240
你知道吗 我不会 因为想要被喜欢或被爱而道歉
And you know what? I'm not gonna apologize for wanting to be liked or loved.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.950
我们很幸运 干着世上最非凡的两份工作
We're blessed with two of the most extraordinary jobs ever created,

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.700
这份工作的一部分 就是灌输希望 让人们感觉美好
and part of that job is to instill hope. It's to make people feel good.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:17.370
但是根据我的经验 希望最终只会带来失望
Yeah, well, based on my experience, okay, hope is just delayed disappointment.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.660
希望既填不饱肚子 也遮不了风雨
Doesn't put food on the table. Doesn't put a roof over anyone's head.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.120
如果你只想着如何让人们感觉美好
And if you want to focus on making people "feel good,"

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.450
那你就永远无法理解如何帮助他们
then you're never gonna understand how to help them.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.620
你是总司令 不是拉斯维加斯的DJ
You are the commander in chief. You're not some DJ in Vegas.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.910
我的职位头衔用不着你提醒
I don't need to be refreshed on my job title.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.160
我们把话说清楚
Let's be clear about that.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.450
别告诉机长我偷了他的藏货给你们
Don't tell the captain I snuck you his stash.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.410
多谢
Thanks.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.370
前往拦截
Move to intercept.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.200
要知道 等你的蜜月期结束
Just know, once this honeymoon period is over,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.740
你的未来只会让你失望
there is only disappointment in your future,

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.040
因为这份工作 我的工作 就是受苦
because this job, my job, is about suffering.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.490
是吗 预言家先生 等那天真来了 咱俩倒是可以坐下来
Yeah, Nostradamus? When that day comes, maybe then you and I can sit down

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.370
好好聊一聊炸鱼薯条
and talk about it over some fish and chips.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.540
我就知道你迟早会说真话 果然如此
I knew the truth would come out. There it is.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.490
真棒 你成功了 阿加莎克里斯蒂破案了
Oh, great. You did it, Agatha Christie. You cracked the case.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.580
- 给大家奖励点史酷比饼干吧 - 威廉 翻篇吧
- Let's give Scooby Snacks to everybody. - Will, let it go.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.700
你大白天在莱塞特广场正中央
You took my opponent for fish and chips in broad daylight

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.740
请我的竞争对手吃炸鱼薯条 你明知道那里全是摄影师
in the middle of "Liester" Square, and you knew photographers would be there!

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.540
是莱斯特广场
First of all, it's pronounced Leicester Square.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.790
别闹了 他是老朋友 我只是带他去吃午饭
And, no, bollocks, he's an old friend. I took him for lunch.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.410
你明知道这会引人遐想
You knew there were political implications.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.540
又不是人人都能仰仗 议会中剑桥精英集团的政治资源
Not all of us have some posh Cambridge Mafia in Parliament

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.910
赢得选举
helping us get elected!

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.370
我拼了命才走到这里
I busted my ass to get to where I am.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:01.950
我出生于政府公屋社区
I was born in a housing estate

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.080
从未享有任何特权资源
and was never given anything on a silver platter.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.660
为了交剑桥的学费 我打了三份工 然后又去参军
I worked three jobs to pay for Cambridge,

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.080
然后开始社区组织工作 继而担任国防武官职务
and then to the Army, and then to community organizing,

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.080
我是一步步从议会基层爬上来的 懂吗 不是所有人搞政治
and then Defence Attaché, and worked my way up through Parliament. Now, not all of us got our political start

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.450
都靠经纪公司看上 你那副“大兵乔”的帅脸
because some commercial agent decided they like our G.I. Joe jawline!

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:19.370
注意你的语言
Watch it!

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.910
你从内裤模特混到走红毯
No, no, no! You went from modeling your underwear to being on the red carpet

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.330
一直到摸到核按钮
to having your finger on the nuclear button,

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.000
连一天基层都没干过
all without doing a single day of public service!

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.040
说真的 伙计 看到你在这扮总统
So, yes, mate, when I see you play the role of president,

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.620
我恶心得都要吐了 你就会念台词
it makes me sick to my stomach, because you know your lines--

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.040
你可太会了
oh, yes, you do--

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.040
但总统这个角色你可演不来
but you're not believable in the part.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.990
我要是能给你对手站台 早站了
And if I could've endorsed your opponent, yes, I would've,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.740
至少这样白宫里会有一个真领袖
because at least there'd be a real leader in the White House

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.830
而不是个丢人现眼 只会爆米花政治的戏精总统
and not some embarrassing, bullshit, popcorn president!

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.410
- 什么  - 你听到我说的了
- What's that? - You heard what I said!

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:48.540
不是 那是什么
No, what's that?

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.790
先生们 待在办公室 保证自己安全
Sirs, secure yourselves in the office. Fasten your seatbelts.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.160
系好安全带 先生 请坐下
Sir. Take your seat, please.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.660
发生什么了
What's happening?

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.080
不明航空器 你已进入限制空域
Unidentified aircraft, you're in restricted airspace.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.700
立即转向撤离 否则将遭火力拦截
Pull away immediately or you will be fired upon.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.740
全频段无线电失效
All radios are out.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.200
所有通讯全部中断
Comms are fried across the board.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.830
天啊
Dear God.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.580
- 准备武器 - 是 长官
- Ready the weapons. - Yes, sir.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:34.790
大事不妙
Oh, shit.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.120
先生们
Uh, gentlemen.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.410
被多枚武器锁定
Multiple inbound bogies!

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:55.700
开火
Open fire!

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.330
总统先生 先生
Mr. President! Sir!

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.250
这是怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.370
该死
Shit.

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.910
我们得去飞机后部 快走
We got to get to the back of the plane! Go! Go! Go!

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.370
别再射无人机了
Stop shooting the drones!

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:34.870
快射飞机
Shoot the goddamn plane!

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:56.410
抓紧了
Hold on!

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.620
紧急下降至10000英尺 以稳定舱内压力
Initiating emergency descent to 10,000 for cabin pressure stabilization.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.620
走 后面有降落伞
Let's go! There are parachutes in the back!

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.290
又来了一波
Here comes another wave.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.660
二号引擎失灵
We lost engine two.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.080
准备压杆操作
Gonna lean into it.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.870
快 我们得跳过去
Come on, we got to jump!

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.120
那边 穿过门
That way! Through the door!

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.250
快 先生 快走
Come on, sir! Move!

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:12.500
正在改平
We're leveling out.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.250
他们完蛋了
They're finished.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:19.830
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:33.620
走
Let's go!

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.700
快点 快走 快
Come on! Let's move! Quick!

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.080
这两个应该能用
These two should be intact.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.870
该死 我们要落在白俄罗斯领空
Shit! We're going down in Belarusian airspace.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.450
你们得去我们在波兰的安全屋
You'll need to get to our safe house in Poland.

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.870
跳出去后使劲拉手柄 剩下的就交给降落伞
Rip it hard once you're out. The chute'll do the rest.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.160
你跟我用一个伞
We can double up.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.830
不行 太冒险了
Not a chance. Too risky.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.160
那这些人怎么办
What about all these people?

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.830
我们都有自己的职责
We all have our jobs to do.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.500
你们的职责就是活下去

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:19.410
去华沙格达通斯克大桥下面的 金山矿业公司
Get to Golden Mountain Mining Company under the Gdanski Bridge in Warsaw.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.080
先生们 重复一遍

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.000
金山矿业公司

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.450
格达通斯克大桥
Gdanski Bridge!

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.200
我很荣幸 总统先生
It's been an honor, Mr. President.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.700
该死
Oh, shit.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:19.160
我们刚刚收到一段令人震惊的影像
We have just received devastating footage

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.790
显示空军一号在白俄罗斯西部坠毁

威廉姆德林杰总统 和萨缪尔克拉克首相
President William Derringer and Prime Minister Samuel Clarke...

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.620
据推测已遇难
are presumed dead.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.620
我们正等待五角大楼 就事故潜在原因或嫌疑人发表声明
We're awaiting word from the Pentagon on the potential cause or suspects.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:38.000
目前尚无组织宣称 对这起悲剧性事件负责
No groups are claiming responsibility for this tragic loss.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.410
议会正召开紧急会议商讨继任方案
An emergency session of Parliament is convening to discuss succession strategy,

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:45.240
片刻前 伊丽莎白科克副总统
while moments ago V.P. Elizabeth Kirk was sworn in

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:48.080
在意大利得里雅斯特 宣誓就任代理总统
as acting president in Trieste, Italy.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.540
当地聚集的北约领导人正表达哀悼
...where gathering NATO leaders are offering their condolences

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.700
与坚定支持
and unyielding solidarity.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:57.040
这场本该是北大西洋联盟的庆典
What was meant to be a celebration of the North Atlantic Alliance

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.580
此刻被前所未有的震惊与哀悼淹没
is now a time of unprecedented shock and mourning.

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.290
妈呀
Oh, geez.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.540
你还好吗
You okay?

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.950
还好 你呢
Yeah. You?

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.120
他们怎么上我的飞机的
How the hell'd they get on my plane?

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.540
肯定是有内奸帮忙
With the help of someone on the inside, that's for sure.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.910
波兰边境要往那边走24公里
The Polish border is about 15 miles that way.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.580
步行的话我们明早就能到安全屋了
On foot, we can be at that safe house by morning.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.660
不用 救援马上就到
No. The cavalry's coming.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.660
不会有救援的 伙计
Cavalry's not coming, mate.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.040
白俄罗斯会控制坠机现场
Belarus will want to control the crash site.

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.790
他们不会让任何飞机进入领空的
Won't be letting any planes into their airspace,

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:50.490
我们的人不可能为了捡尸体 偷偷穿越敌军防线
and there's no way our guys are sneaking across enemy lines to retrieve corpses.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.290
他们只能当无人生还
They have to assume there are no survivors.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:55.410
该死
Shit.

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:57.870
你在干什么
What are you doing?

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.040
给我妻子打电话 我要让她知道我还活着
Calling my wife. I'm letting her know I'm alive.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.290
不行 不能打电话 好吗
No. No, no, no, no. No. No phones. All right?

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.910
- 照我说的做 - 什么
Do as I do.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:07.040
我们刚经历了史上最严重的安全漏洞
We just survived the worst security breach in history,

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.330
所以你必须假设 想要你命的人
so you have to assume whoever wants you dead

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.990
正在监听通讯
is listening to communications, okay?

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.950
我得让我的家人知道我没事
I'm calling my family to let them know I'm okay.

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:15.740
我们得让全世界知道我们没事
And we should let the world know we're okay.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.330
瞧瞧吧 我们哪没事了
We're not okay.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:21.080
听好了 如果我们落入敌手 最好的情况是
All right? If we fall into the wrong hands,

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.870
被当作政治筹码踢来踢去
they use us as a political football.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:26.620
最坏的情况是他们会杀鸡儆猴
Worst-case scenario is... they make an example of us.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.870
把手机放下
Now put that down!

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.830
知道上一个向在职总统扔鞋的人 是什么下场吗
You know what happened to the last guy who threw a shoe at a sitting president?

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.250
是挂得挺“直”的
You're not sitting. You're hanging. All right?

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.450
听好了 滚开
You know what? Piss off.

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.660
- 你想让我滚开  - 是的
- You want me to piss off? - Yeah.

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.410
好吧 我滚
Okay, I'll piss off.

00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:44.160
我一路滚到华沙
I'll piss off all the way to Warsaw.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.620
你自己在鸟类保护区欢度余生吧
Enjoy living the rest of your life as a bird sanctuary.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.080
好吧 别滚
All right, don't piss off.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.290
拜托 帮我下来好吗
Would you just help me down for Chrissakes, please?

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:58.830
好吧 瞧瞧
There you go. Look at that.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.330
一个美国动作片英雄还得我帮忙
An American action hero asking me for help.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:06.410
手上做着最高尚的事 嘴巴还是这么小气刻薄
Even in his most noble moments, he was still petty and mean-spirited.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.160
我数到三就放你下去
I'm gonna drop you on three.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:10.700
三
Three!

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.910
- 你还好吧 德林杰  - 我还好
- You all right back there, Derringer? - I'm fine.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:27.700
- 听见好重的喘气声跟呼哧声 - 我没呼哧 好吗
- Hearing a lot of panting and snuffling. - I don't snuffle, okay?

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.740
再说了 少操心别人怎么喘气
Besides, don't concern yourself with how another man breathes.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:31.830
有点边界感 伙计
Boundaries, guy.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.580
没什么好不好意思的
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.080
你这样的人本来就没什么毅力
Endurance is tough for guys like you.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.790
- 我这样的人  - 对 你这样的人 健身房强者
- Guys like me? - Guys like you. You know, gym strong.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:40.990
-“健身房强者”  - 健身房强者
- Gym strong? - Gym strong.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.080
而不是
As opposed to?

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.290
真正的强者
Strong strong.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.490
你想看看健身房强者的本事吗
Want to see gym strong?

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.330
我要把树从地上拔出来抡死你
I'll rip a tree out of the ground and beat you to death with it, huh?

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:51.540
快动手吧
Go on, then.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.500
什么
What?

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.410
把那棵树从地上拔出来抡死我
Rip that tree out and beat me to death with it.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.040
我就知道
That's what I thought.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.330
别再说蠢话了
Silly thing to say, really.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.000
谁让你选最粗的树了
Picked the biggest tree.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:16.450
我的天啊
Dear God.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.370
我觉得应该没人能活下来
Think he's had the day off.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.950
这是谁干的
Who the hell did this?

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:26.660
我们有很多敌人
We got a lot of enemies.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.200
但现在我们的任务是活着回去
Right now we got to get home alive. That's our job.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.120
错 真正的任务是揪出幕后黑手 让他们血债血偿
No, our real job is to find out who did this and make them pay.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.240
我和你一样想抓住他们 但这不是一朝一夕的事
Look, I want to get them just as much as you do, but these things don't happen overnight.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:37.990
我们得找准时刻 我们花了十年时间 发起两次战争
We got to pick our moment. Took us ten years and two wars

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.540
- 才抓到本拉登 - 我不会再等十年了
- before we got bin Laden. - I'm not waiting ten years.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:44.160
有一件事是肯定的 做出这事的人很有胆量
One thing for certain, whoever did this got some big balls.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.910
我认为这绝对只是个开头
There's no reason to think this wasn't just phase one.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.580
告诉五角大楼提高防御状态
Tell the Pentagon to move DEFCON status up,

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.620
并告知俄罗斯 中国和伊朗 此刻不要有任何冒险的举动
and inform Russia, China and Iran this is not a moment to get adventurous.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.540
别挑战我们 别以为我们分心了
Don't challenge us and don't think we're distracted.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.450
什么事
Yes?

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.620
“梯队”正在等待系统安全更新
Echelon is standing by for system security update.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.700

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.040

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.160
发生什么事了
What's happening?

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.910
他们在重启系统

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.500
倒计时三 二 一
In three, two, one.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:12.500

有人入侵了系统
Someone's inside the system.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:20.870
发生什么了
Uh, wh-what's happening?

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.120
我们已经取得了“梯队”的控制权
We are now in control of Echelon.

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.540
这才像话嘛 我们去华沙的车有了
Now we're talking. There's our ride to Warsaw.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.740
我们不能就这么走过去 让他们载我们一程
We can't just walk down and ask them for a lift.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.200
我同意 但你错了 我们可以
I'd agree with you, but you're wrong. We can.

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.500
我们可是地球上最出名的两个人
We're two of the most recognizable men on the planet.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.040
你连最出名的英国人都算不上
Ha. You're not even one of the most recognizable British people.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.990
- 你懂我意思 - 重点是我们需要帮助
- You get my point. - The point is we need help,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.950
所以我们就找他们求助
we ask them for help.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.790
你不明白“保持低调”的意思吗
What part of "keep our heads down" don't you understand?

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.870
- 你有更好的主意  - 当然 我建议动作快点
- You got a better idea? - Yeah, I do. I say we move fast,

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:01.870
沿着树林边摸过去 去把那辆车偷了
creep along that tree line and hot-wire that car over there.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.370
- 你什么时候学会偷车了  - 我不会 但你会
- Since when do you know how to hot-wire? - I don't, but you do.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.830
你16岁因为偷了邻居的科迈罗被抓过
You got busted at 16 for stealing your neighbor's Camaro.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:14.290
- 你从哪听说的  - 我查过你了
- Where'd you hear about that? - I vetted you.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.410
你查过我了
You vetted me?

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:19.000
我是美国总统 应该是我查你
I'm the President of the United States. You don't vet me. I vet you.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:22.040
那你查我了吗
Well, did you vet me?

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.580
这不是重点
Not the point.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:32.500
加油
Come on. Come on.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.290
耶 搞定
Yeah, there he is.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:37.540

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.240
我去跟他们聊聊 他们会载我们一程的
I'm going to talk to them. They'll give us a ride.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:53.700
不不不 赶紧把车启动 我们离开这里
No, no, no. You're gonna start this car, and we're gonna get out of here.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.120
信我 我跟喝啤酒的小伙子很合得来
Trust me. I poll really well with young men who drink beer.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.490
我跟他们有共同语言
I speak their language.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.370
你跟他们有共同语言才怪了
Except you literally don't speak their language.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.950
电影就是国际语言
Cinema is the international language.

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:02.740
- 看我展现魅力 - 威廉 嘿
- Watch the magic. - Will. Hey.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:04.160
嘿 伙计们 你们好吗

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.790
我们迷路了 你们能帮帮忙吗
We got a little turned around. We could use some help.

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:10.700
是我啊 威廉德林杰
It's me, Will Derringer.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:14.450
你们肯定知道
You know, Water Cobra.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.290
《水蟒》

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.450
怎么没反应
Huh, still nothing?

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.660
手表不错
Nice watch.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.830
我觉得你应该把手表给他
I think you should give him the watch.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.000
给我戴着试下
Let me try it on.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.950
这是基努在《大屠杀2》杀青时 送我的礼物
This is a gift from Keanu when we wrapped Carnage 2.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:38.740
好吧 希望基努还送过你功夫课
Yeah, well, I hope Keanu gifted you some kung fu lessons,

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.580
因为我们马上就要挨揍了
'cause we're about to get our asses kicked.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.790
伙计 你搞错情况了
Man, read the room.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.830
这下明白了
See?

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:47.910
够了
That's enough!

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.580
你右边
On your right!

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.540
对不起
Oh, sorry.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:09.540
别出手
Don't.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:12.830
住手
Stop!

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.540
我说住手
I said, stop!

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.700
你做了什么
What have you done?

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.830
你们死定了
You are dead men.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:41.080
嘿
Hey!

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.450
你还好吗
Ah, God. You okay?

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.990
赶紧滚回家
Get your asses home!

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.700
你们这群蠢蛋
You half-witted cretins!

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:50.830
美国人
Yankees?

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:53.200
不不不 加拿大人
No, no, no. Canadians.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.040
为什么要说是加拿大人  人人都爱美国人
Why'd you say Canadians? Everybody loves Americans.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.330
只有美国人爱美国人 我们是加拿大人 相信我
Americans love Americans. Today we're Canadians. Trust me.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.290
你们要去哪里
Where you go?

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.830
越过边境去华沙
Across the border to Warsaw.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.290
文件呢
Papers?

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:06.290
没有文件
No papers.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:09.290
好吧
Okay.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.450
我带你们去
I take you.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:14.910
我的车超棒
I have great ride.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.500
这经历写进回忆录肯定很赞
Eh, it'll be great for our memoirs.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:53.120
“第14章 就像丘吉尔第一次会见
"Chapter 14. It was exactly like when Churchill met FDR for the first time,

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.950
罗斯福时一样 不过混着一点羊屎味”
just with an added splash of sheep shit."

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:57.910
情况本来可能会更糟
Could be worse.

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:00.740
还好有好心陌生人搭救
We're experiencing the kindness of a stranger.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:02.080
现在我们能去安全的地方了
We're en route to safety.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:06.160
等我们安全了 我们就要让敌人感受到愤怒的巨浪
Shortly after we get there, we'll make our enemies feel the ripple of our wrath.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.290
- 那是不是... - 过去十年中最具开创性的
- Is-is that the... - Battle cry of the central character

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:12.790
动作片系列之一的 核心人物的战斗呐喊 当然
in one of the most seminal action franchises in the last decade? Hell yeah.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.120
怎么了
What?

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.240
你们英国人的口号难道喊得很好吗
What do you Brits know about slogans anyway?

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.870
“保持冷静 继续生活”
"Keep calm and carry on."

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:20.790
你们知道吗
You know, that-that's actually like saying,

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:23.790
这跟说“什么都别做 以后也别做” 有什么区别
"Do nothing and continue to do nothing," right?

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:26.790
是啊 我们对口号的 崇拜程度可不一样
Yeah, we don't all fetishize taglines to the same degree.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:27.700
- 是吗  - 对
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.910
好吧 这就是我不明白的点 好吗
Well, here's what I don't get, okay?

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:32.700
既然觉得人生是走不出的失败死循环
If life is such a M?bius strip of failure and futility,

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.870
那你为什么还要领导一个国家
why would you want to lead an entire nation?

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:36.450
我喜欢坐在发霉的旧房间里
I just like sitting in musty old rooms,

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.200
和无聊的老男人们争论税法
arguing with boring old men about tax code.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.120
- 行吗  - 真好笑
- Okay? - That's a good one.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.410
说真的
Seriously.

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.750
你为什么要竞选国家最高领导人
Why would you want to run for highest office in the land?

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:51.080
好吧 我先说
Yeah, fine. Me first.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.200
你知道我28岁才第一次出国旅行吗
Did you know I didn't travel outside the U.S. until I was 28 years old?

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.200
是《水蟒》的第一次媒体巡演
First Water Cobra press tour.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:02.370
那次我意识到每个国家的人都很棒
And it was there I realized, man, there are awesome people everywhere.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.000
但这个世界却太支离破碎了
But the world is so damn fractured.

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.790
所以我想如果能用我的名人效应 做出哪怕一点点改变
So I figured if I could use my celebrity, even just for a little bit,

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.250
让人们团结起来 这不是件好事吗
to bring people together, wouldn't that be a good thing?

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.330
好吧 你的理由是什么
Okay. What's your excuse?

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:20.250
绝对不是因为相信自己 能让人们过上更好的生活
Certainly not about believing you'd deliver people to better days.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.040
我相信会有更好的生活
I believe in better days.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:27.620
说真的 今天比任何时候 都让我相信会有更好的生活
In fact, this day has got me believing in better days more than any other day,

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.660
因为哪一天都比
because any day would be better

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.330
跟你和一群羊困在这里强...
than being stuck in the muck with you and a bunch of...

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:33.620
你觉得今天很糟糕
You having a rough one, huh?

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.410
- 是的 - 是吗
- Yeah. - Yeah?

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.410
跟你的安保人员比呢
Take it up with your security detail.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.790
或者跟我的安保比比
Or my security detail.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.040
或者跟那架飞机上的任何人比比
Or anybody on that flight.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:01.450
趴下
Down, down, down, down, down.

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:12.830
牲畜的护照和文件出示一下
Passports and documents for the livestock.

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:20.160
关掉引擎 下车
Kill the engine and get out.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:50.910
你想做个交易吗
Maybe we could make a deal?

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:52.910
什么交易
What?

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.330
我想好回忆录怎么写了
Think I'm ready to write those memoirs now.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:33.830
谢谢
Thank you.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.040
给你
Take this.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.500
我很荣幸
It was my pleasure...

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:41.910
总统先生
Mr. President.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:46.080
祝你们好运
Good luck to both of you.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:15.290
先生 “梯队”截获了华沙中情局 安全屋的监控录像
Sir, Echelon intercepted security footage from a CIA safe house in Warsaw

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:18.040
有两个人刚刚进去了
that just buzzed in two guests.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:21.080
恕我直言
With all due respect,

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.370
我们击落空军一号时 已经拿到了需要的东西
we got what we needed when we took down Air Force One.

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:25.200
闭嘴
Quiet your mouth.

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:29.660
我们的行动很隐蔽 就算他们活着又能怎么样
And we kept our footprint tight, so who cares if they live?

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.000
我说要他们死 他们就得死
They die because I say they die.

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:40.370
他们还活着 在华沙
They're alive. Warsaw.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.120
华沙 出发
Warsaw! Let's go!

00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:59.750
你还活着
You're alive.

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:06.370
嘿 你因为我哭了
Okay. Hey. Are you crying because of me?

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.990
是啊 当然 伙计
Hell yeah, I am, man.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.290
我是说 先生
I mean, sir.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.200
对不起 我是马蒂科米尔
I'm sorry. Marty Comer.

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.330
好吧...
Oh, well.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:16.660
基站探员 超级粉丝
Station agent. A huge fan.

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:18.540
还是个爱国者
Patriot.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:21.700
我是英国首相萨姆克拉克 我们能进去吗
Sam Clarke, British prime minister. Can we come in?

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.750
可以
Yeah.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.160
当然可以
Yeah, of course, of course.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.120
那我们进去了
Like, now?

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.450
- 好的 请进 - 谢谢
- Yeah, now. - Thank you.

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:28.620
这边
Right this way.

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:31.910
好吧 我知道这听起来很疯狂
Okay, so I know this sounds, uh, bonkers,

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:34.080
- 但... - 有预案吗
- but... - What's the playbook on this?

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.160
这事的预案
For this?

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:38.620
哪有这种预案啊 我是说
Th-There is no damn playbook.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.870
我们预案多得很 有针对极移的预案
I mean-- And we got lots of playbooks. Ones that account for pole shifts,

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:44.330
针对电脑有自我意识 太空猴子袭击
computers becoming self-aware, space monkey attacks,

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:46.160
各种乱七八糟的预案
all kinds of hectic shit.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:50.160
但就是没有全世界目睹你们死亡
But, uh, none that contemplate you two sauntering in here

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.700
然后又大摇大摆出现的预案
after dying in front of the entire planet's eyes.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.830
所以没有预案
So no playbook?

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:55.700
现做一个吧
Let's make one.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.580
世人总说“英雄注定令人失望” 但请容我反驳
They say never meet your heroes, but to them I say:

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.500
他们显然从未见识过 威廉姆马修德林杰总统的非凡魅力
You've never met President William Matthew Derringer.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.080
你名字首字母缩写 意思是大规模杀伤性武器
Your initials are WMD?

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.660
是啊 很讨厌 对吧
Yeah. Pretty bitchin', right?

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.660
跟我来 先生们
Follow me, gentlemen.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.370
顺便说一句 你们来得正好
Your timing's great, by the way.

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:16.450
大使刚刚紧急把 所有在境人员召回了使馆
The ambassador just recalled all in-country personnel to the embassy.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:19.200
外面的世界情况很糟糕
It's a real nut punch in a Ziploc bag out there.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.040
要我说这些也不是巧合
And it ain't exactly a coincidence, if you ask me.

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.580
等等 什么不是巧合
W-Wait, what's not?

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.120
首先是你俩坠机
Well, first you two go down,

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.290
然后在北约会议现场 有人突然投下一枚“政治手雷”
and then someone rolls a political grenade into that NATO conference.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.830
你们没听说吗
You guys didn't hear?

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:35.290
没有 我们今天有点忙
No, we've had a pretty busy day.

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:41.370
显然 “梯队”服务器被渗透了
Well, apparently, Echelon servers were infiltrated.

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:48.870
两小时前 一批机密文件被泄露
Two hours ago, a tranche of classified documents were leaked,

00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:52.660
揭露了北约成员国数十年的秘密行动
exposing decades of covert activity amongst NATO members:

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:58.290
工业间谍 经济破坏 干预外国选举
industrial espionage, economic sabotage and the influencing of foreign elections.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:01.620
最令人愤慨的是 这些行径并非针对敌对国家
And the real pisser? These weren't acts committed against enemy nations

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:04.620
而是针对彼此 是盟友间的相互倾轧
but against each other. These were friends against friends.

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:08.120
这简直是《老友记》第二季里 莫妮卡和瑞秋那种级别的塑料姐妹情
I'm talking some real Monica and Rachel season two shit.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:12.370
明天的峰会将会是 电话亭中的困兽之斗
I mean, tomorrow's summit's gonna be a monkey knife fight in a telephone booth.

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:15.370
德国刚发现法国安插记者
Germany just found out France embedded journalists

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:16.950
干预其大选
to influence their last election.

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:19.370
捷克要求将意大利逐出北约
The Czech Republic wants Italy kicked out of the building

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.120
因为意大利蓄意破坏他们的经济
for trying to tank their economy.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.540
而此刻我们却被挡在 全球最强的监控系统门外
All while we're locked out of the most powerful surveillance tool on this planet.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.450
泄露了多少档案
How many files are we talking about?

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:29.240
两万 数量还在增加
20,000 and counting.

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:31.910
这是史上最具破坏性的国家机密泄露
It's the most damaging leak of state secrets in history.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:35.450
有人在利用“梯队” 破坏北约组织的结构
Someone is using Echelon to tear at the very fabric of NATO.

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:38.500
北约一直在破坏自己的组织结构
Sounds like NATO has been tearing at the fabric of itself.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:41.330
我打赌你很想说:“我早这么说过了”
Bet you're dying to say "I told you so."

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:45.120
- 你说什么  - 你当初是喊着“美国优先”赢的初选
- Excuse me? - You ran your primaries on "America first."

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:50.410
西蒙 我允许你来这里 是出于对威廉的尊重
Simone, I am allowing you to be in this room out of respect for Will.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:51.490
允许我
Allowing me?

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.950
但请不要暗示 我对这个联盟有所保留
But please don't ever insinuate that I'm not all in on this alliance.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:00.740
如果北约垮台 就再无针对专制独裁者的屏障了
If NATO falls, there's no more backstop against despots and dictators.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.160
他们将不受任何制约
They run unchecked.

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.990
这可能会引发一系列事件
It could set off a series of events that-that would

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.830
破坏欧洲和世界其他地区的稳定
destabilize Europe and the rest of the world.

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:10.790
我们正在讨论的是 全球范围内冲突升级 秩序崩坏
We are talking about the potential for increased conflict, chaos

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:15.330
乃至真实战争威胁的可能性
and the very real threat of war on a global scale.

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:18.990
我们得出面证明自己还活着
We put our heads above water.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.950
打给大使馆 通知他们我们在这里
Call the embassy. Let them know you have us.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:24.120
不行 我们得假设 所有高官都已被渗透
No, we have to assume all high command posts are compromised.

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.250
胡说
Bullshit.

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:27.990
我们在一个安全的美国设施里
We are in a secure U.S. facility.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.540
想尝尝品客薯片不
You guys want a hit of these Pringles?

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:33.000
上次我在安全的美国设施里时 我们被从四万英尺高空击落
Last time I was in one of those, we got shot out of the sky at 40,000 feet.

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:35.580
打电话
Make the call.

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:37.290
不许打电话
Don't make the call.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.000
打电话
Make the call.

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.370
不许打电话
Don't make the call.

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:43.620
这电话我打不了
I can't make the call.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.490
我是总司令 打电话
I'm the commander in chief! Make the goddamn call.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.580
线路断了
The line's dead.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.250
这正常吗
Is that normal?

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:50.910
不正常
No.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:05.080
有些人是真想让我们死啊
Somebody really wants us dead.

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.750
我们在安全屋里很安全 对吧
We're safe, we're in a safe house, right?

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.620
我们能搞定的
We got this.

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:14.540
这些能给你们安全感吗
That feel safe enough for you?

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:31.580
- 该死 - 这可不是演电影 小伙子
- Shit. - Not in the movies now, son.

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:51.240
好了 听好
Okay, listen up.

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:54.200
我会带你们离开 但万一情况不妙
I'm gonna get you guys out of here, but just in case things do go south,

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.120
从第二出口撤退
best to beat a retreat through the secondary exit.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.160
从这里出去左转 穿过大厅再左转 有个宿舍房间
That's a left out of here, down the hall, make a left. That's the bunk room.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.120
右手边墙上有张海报
Another right, you should see a poster on the wall.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.450
冲着海报打一拳就能顺利撤离了
You punch through that poster, you should be good to go.

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:14.700
帮我把电缆拉好 伙计们
Feed me, boys.

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:04.790
萨沙 萨沙

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.830
全都给我进来 快
All of you in here! Now!

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.740
这小子真疯啊
That boy's a nutter.

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:26.870
也许吧
Maybe,

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:28.450
我们大美国的疯子
but he's America's nutter.

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.160
走
Let's move.

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:41.160
快走
Get out of here.

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.080
快走
Go!

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.000
快走
Come on!

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:03.330
不对 这边 他说右转
No, no, this way. He said right!

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:06.080
该死
Damn it!

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:12.120
别修了 约翰兰博 快走
No, no, Rambo! Come on!

00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:17.120
找到海报了
Oh, found the poster.

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:18.620
打一拳
Punch it.

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.290
该死
Oh, goddamn it.

00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:21.950
- 有什么问题  - 我做不到
- What's the problem? - I can't.

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.910
你是在搞笑吗 赶紧的啊
You having a laugh?! Come on!

00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:29.000
原谅我
Forgive me.

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:54.830
我觉得我好像把那家伙干掉了
I think I killed that guy.

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.870
你干掉的只有那面墙
Only thing you killed is the wall.

00:57:57.790 --> 00:57:59.120
不过我不得不说
I have to say, though,

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.450
你拿枪的样子确实挺酷
you do look good with a gun in your hand.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.580
- 你先出去 - 不 你先出去
- You should go. - No, you go.

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:13.040
放下枪
Drop your guns!

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:16.700
抓到他们了
We have them.

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:19.000
收到
Coming down.

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:49.120
诺埃尔
Noel?

00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:51.200
萨姆
Sam?

00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:56.370
我以为你死了
- I thought you were dead. - I thought you were dead.

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:58.410
你怎么会没死呢
How are you not dead?

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.830
你们俩认识
You two know each other?

00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:03.660
- 我们... - 我们以前是同事
- We... - We worked together. Back in the day.

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.200
你怎么找到我们的
How'd you find us?

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:16.620
不要

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:20.580
好吧 我告诉你
All right, I'll tell you!

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.620
说来话长
Long story.

00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:36.540
嘿 你的后援呢
Hey, where's your backup?

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.080
没有后援
There is no backup.

00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.990
我从西班牙就开始跟踪格拉多夫了
I've been trailing Gradov since Spain.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.240
- 维克托格拉多夫是幕后黑手  - 那个军火贩子
- Victor Gradov is behind this? - The gun guy?

00:59:57.250 --> 01:00:00.370
你是说 这一切都是 为了报复我们阻止他制造核武器
So you're saying this is all payback because we stopped him building nukes?

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:01.290
那边走
That way.

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:03.040
格拉多夫没有造核弹
Gradov wasn't building a nuke.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.870
但他是个军火商啊
But he was a weapons developer.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.620
他是 但他的儿子不是
He was, but his son wasn't.

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.450
- 他儿子跟这有什么关系  - 他儿子是个科学家
- Yeah, what's his son got to do with it? - His son was a scientist.

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:12.040
他非常聪明 取得了令人难以置信的突破
He was brilliant and made incredible breakthroughs.

01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:13.830
他本来马上就能造出
He was on the brink of onlining

01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:17.040
全球第一个“免堆芯融毁”核反应堆
the first ever nuclear reactor incapable of melting down.

01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:19.330
球床反应堆技术
The pebble-bed technology.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:21.450
我们那个球床反应堆技术
Our pebble-bed technology?

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:23.540
我们告诉全世界是我们研发的那个
The same technology I just told the world that we developed?

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.080
其实是格拉多夫的儿子发明的
You're telling me Gradov's son invented it?

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.330
他差一点就成功了
He was close.

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:28.200
当时他还需要一些浓缩钚
He still needed the enriched plutonium,

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.290
他父亲从黑市给他买了一批
which his father procured from the black market.

01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:31.990
这笔交易被“梯队”监测到了
Echelon picked up on that transaction.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.540
理所当然 我们以为他们要造核武器
Of course we assumed it was to build a weapon.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.200
所以我们做了面对核威胁时该做的事
So we did what one does when faced with a nuclear threat.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.200
我们朝额头扔弹头了
You dropped warheads on foreheads?

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.120
没错
We did.

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:43.620
死者中就有格拉多夫的儿子
Gradov's son was amongst the dead.

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:46.790
那次行动是北约批准的
The operation was sanctioned by NATO.

01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:50.330
我们承担不起他制造核弹的风险
We couldn't risk the chance that he was building a nuke.

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:52.620
那会危机数百万人的生命
Millions of lives were at stake.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.290
事后我们才发现他造的到底是什么
It was only in the aftermath we realized what was actually being developed.

01:00:56.910 --> 01:01:00.540
于是在“梯队”的帮助下 我们得到了球床反应堆技术的图纸
So with the help of Echelon, we procured the schematics for the pebble-bed tech.

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:01.450
躲起来
Get back.

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:11.410
所以我们夺走了 他儿子的性命和遗产
So we took his son's life and then his legacy, huh?

01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:13.990
还打算为此在得里雅斯特大肆庆祝
Which we were about to take a big victory lap for in Trieste.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.370
恕我直言 但好像我们才是反派啊
Correct me if I'm doing the math wrong, but we're the assholes here.

01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:19.870
听着 格拉多夫的儿子 不是因我们而死
Okay, look. Gradov's son didn't die because of us.

01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:22.080
他死是因为他是魔鬼的儿子
He died because he's the son of the devil.

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:24.040
继续走
Let's keep it moving.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.540
没有最高级别安全 格拉多夫是不可能做到的
Gradov couldn't have done all this without top-level security clearance.

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:31.790
问题是格拉多夫的内奸到底是谁
Okay, so then the question is: Who was Gradov working with on the inside?

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:34.040
得从那个安排我们登机的人开始查起
Got to start with the guy who put us both in that plane.

01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:35.790
什么
What?

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.540
你本不该和我一起飞的
You weren't supposed to fly with me.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.370
有人刻意向你灌输这个念头 并持续强化它
Somebody put that idea in your head, insisted on it.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.250
昆西
Quincy.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.410
华沙一处安全屋遭到袭击
A safe house was hit in Warsaw.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:52.200
你觉得是怎么回事
What are you thinking?

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:54.240
可能是威廉和萨姆吗
Could be Will and Sam?

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:56.790
一定有什么值得追查的
There must have been something in there worth going after.

01:01:57.450 --> 01:02:00.370
- 我们必须考虑这种可能性... - 难道你看到的和我们不一样
- We have to consider the possibility... - Did you not see what we all saw?

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:02.790
他们和空军一号一起坠毁了
They went down with Air Force One.

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:05.620
我不会放弃希望的 至少目前不会
I'm not giving up hope. Not yet.

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.040
我们都不该放弃
None of us should be.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.040
我们必须集中精力 处理这次“梯队”泄密事件
We need to focus all our energies on this Echelon leak.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.540
舆论愈演愈烈
The rhetoric is heating up.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.580
但如果威廉和萨姆可能还活着...
But if there's even a chance that Will and Sam are still alive...

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:17.870
我们让中情局负责调查华沙的安全屋 而在这栋大楼里
We put CIA on the safe house in Warsaw. And right here in this building,

01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:20.080
重点是和北约一起控制事态恶化
the focus is on stopping the bleeding with NATO.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.830
我想尽快与 意大利 德国和法国会面
I want an audience with Italy, Germany and France as soon as possible.

01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:25.990
让这些家伙们别再惺惺作态
It's time these guys stopped clutching their pearls

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.080
赶紧开始履行领导职责
and get on with the business of leading.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.620
是我儿子 见谅
It's my son. Excuse me.

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:32.290
嗨 亲爱的
Hi, sweetheart.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:35.450
西蒙 我知道威廉对你有多重要
Simone, I appreciate how much Will meant to you.

01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:38.000
我知道他像你亲兄弟一样 但他已经死了
I know he was like a brother, but he's gone.

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:39.910
他们都死了
They're both gone.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.910
你得开始接受这个现实
You need to start wrapping your head around that.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:48.830
不可能是昆西
There's no way it's Quincy.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.990
你怎么能确定
How can you be sure?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.830
他是我的幕僚长 大学时代就相识的老搭档
He's been my chief of staff for six years. I known him since university.

01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:55.410
是普通人眼里的他 还是你认知中的他
The way normal people know him or the way you know people?

01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:56.790
又开始了
Ah, don't start that shit again.

01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:59.040
他喜欢香肠薯泥还是炸鱼薯条
Does he like bangers and mash or fish and chips?

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.330
我知道你想干嘛
Ah, I see what you did there.

01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:02.950
又想开始讨论炸鱼薯条的事
Sneaking the fish and chips back into the conversation.

01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:05.410
为了这事你可真是绞尽脑汁啊
You must be exhausted trying to figure that out.

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:07.870
别互相挑来挑去 我们需要保持统一口味
Stop chipping away at each other. We need to be on the same page.

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:10.410
- 她是在用双关讽刺我们  - 她喜欢双关
- Did she just hit us with a pun? - She loves a pun.

01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:12.870
我告诉过她 双关只适合心思简单的人
I tried to tell her puns are for simple people.

01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:13.870
可我喜欢双关啊
I love puns.

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:15.620
- 说的就是你 - 各位
- My point exactly. - Guys!

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:18.370
这边
Over here.

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:20.200
快过来
Come on.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.450
听着 现在关键是去得里雅斯特
Look, right now the key is getting to Trieste.

01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:24.370
得里雅斯特
Trieste?

01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:26.870
美国大使馆离这里有多远  他们能帮忙
How far away is the U.S. embassy from here? They can help us.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:28.540
我们不去大使馆
We're not going to the embassy.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.700
等等 你们怎么都不让我去大使馆
Wait, why won't anyone let me go to my embassy?

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.040
为什么大家突然都反对大使馆了
What does everybody suddenly have against embassies?

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:38.950
我们得假定所有高官都已被渗透
We have to presume that all high command posts are compromised.

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:40.540
你再说一遍我会尖叫的
Say that again, I'm gonna scream.

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.750
不是普通尖叫 而是喉底迸发的哀嚎
Not just a conventional scream, a guttural wail.

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:44.750
我们走
Let's go.

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:47.660
听着 我才是总司令
Listen, I'm the commander in chief.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.990
好吧 恕我直言先生 你不是
Okay, respectfully, sir, no, you're not.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.450
副总统几小时前已宣誓就职
The vice president was sworn in a few hours ago.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.790
至于他 他从来都不是总司令
And he has never been commander in chief of anything.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:56.700
国王才是
The king is.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.540
事实上他是唯一一个 不是真正国家元首的国家元首
In fact, he's the only head of state that's not an actual head of state.

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.080
国王才是
Again, king.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.540
你们只是两个倒霉蛋
You're just two guys that are shit out of luck.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.500
所以 走吧
So let's go.

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:07.290
来吧
Come on.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.910
你们现在是我的包裹
You are now my package.

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:18.040
也是我的任务
My mission.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.040
我的任务就是把你俩活着
And my mission is to deliver you alive

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.990
送到这片大陆上最安全的地方去
to the most secure location on this continent,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.290
也就是在得里雅斯特的北约峰会
and that is the NATO summit in Trieste.

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:29.200
要让任务不脱轨 这列火车就是我们最好的机会
And my best shot at keeping this mission on track is that train.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:33.540
双关 这次不是故意的
Pun, this time, not intended!

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.330
你是带我们开火车的车头吗
You seem very "locomotivated"!

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:39.910
只是想确保计划不会脱轨
Trying to make sure this thing doesn't go off the rails!

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:41.740
果然如此
Ha! Well, that confirms it!

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:44.000
坠机时我肯定已经死了 跟你俩在一起简直是地狱
I died in that plane crash, and this is hell!

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.080
加油
Come on!

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.500
拉住你了

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.620
你还好吗
You good?

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.660
谢谢
Thank you.

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:04.500
你的团队在西班牙的事...
About your team in Spain.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.660
我们都失去了很多
We've all lost a lot.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:12.910
听着 我欠你...
Look, I-I owe you a...

01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:14.910
请你不要说抱歉
Please don't say an apology.

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:18.040
只是想解释下 的黎波里之后我为什么消失了
An explanation for disappearing after Tripoli.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.370
在的黎波里发生了什么
What happened in Tripoli?

01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:24.620
不关你的事
None of your business.

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.370
继续睡觉吧
Go back to sleep.

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:28.700
首先 你没有在的黎波里消失
Okay, first of all, you didn't disappear in Tripoli.

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.830
你无处不在
You appeared everywhere.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.830
你上过电视 报纸 社交媒体...
You were on TV, newspapers, social media...

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:35.830
- 我在竞选公职 - 你在逃避
- I was running for office. - You were running away.

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:36.950
是因为爱吗
Was it love?

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.330
你在逃避爱吗
Were you running away from love?

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.490
你能管好自己的事吗
Can you stay in your lane?

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.620
你本可以跟我一起
And you could have come with me.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.870
一起参加竞选活动
On the campaign trail?

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:51.200
比如去上早间节目 和全世界分享我妈妈的千层面食谱
Like, go on breakfast TV and share my mom's lasagna recipe with the world?

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.790
我们本可以在一起的
We would have been together.

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:55.000
不 萨姆
No, Sam.

01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:58.000
我们不可能在一起的
We couldn't have been together.

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:05.240
我去吃点东西 需要什么吗 总统先生
I'm gonna go get something to eat. Can I get you anything, Mr. President?

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:07.450
你吃什么给我带一份就行
I'll have whatever you're having.

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:08.950
没问题
You got it.

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.620
我可能要问越界的问题了
I'm just gonna go out on a limb here.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.500
你们俩以前不只是同事关系对吧
You two did a little more than work together back in the day, huh?

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.290
我是说 她看起来人很好
I mean, she seems nice.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.580
比你的最好朋友幕僚长好多了
A lot better than that best friend chief of staff of yours

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.200
- 那个卧底间谍 - 我不想和你聊这些
- that's a sleeper spy insurgent. - We're not having this conversation.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.120
听着 伙计 她在感情上有点淡漠
Listen, man, she's a little emotionally distant.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.750
不过很有幽默感
Great sense of humor, though.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:40.660
嘿
Hey.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.330
你们为什么分开了
Why'd you guys split up?

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:45.240
又来了 不停问问题
And he's back. Back to questions.

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:47.160
拜托 在的黎波里发生了什么
Come on. What happened in Tripoli?

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.240
- 别问了 - 在的黎波里发生了什么 萨姆
- Don't. - Come on. What happened in Tripoli, Sam?

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:50.990
别再说的黎波里了
Stop saying "Tripoli"!

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.790
好吧 在利比亚首都发生了什么
Fine, what happened in the capital city of Libya?

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:57.410
我在那里告诉了她我想竞选首相
It's where I told her that I wanted to run for office.

01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:58.490
你满意了吗
Are you happy now?

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.910
- 你为什么想竞选  - 你还问
- And why'd you want to run for office? - Oh, God, are you still going?

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.660
你为什么想竞选 萨姆
Why'd you want to run for office, Sam?

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:06.700
因为我想为她打造一个更好的世界 我们可以一起在这世界里白头偕老
Because, because I wanted to build a better world for her and I to grow old in together!

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:12.410
这真是...
That's...

01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:17.750
我听过的最浪漫的事
...the most romantic goddamn thing I've ever heard.

01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:19.540
她可不是...
Yeah, well, she didn't...

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.540
她可不是这么想的
she didn't see it that way.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.950
- 该死  - 我们可以商量一下
- Shit! - Whoa, whoa. We can talk this out.

01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:31.450
我知道你们都很迷恋自己的声音
I know you're both enamored with the sound of your own voice,

01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:33.660
但你们谁也不许说话了
but there's no more talking.

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:38.700
搞什么鬼
What the hell?!

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.000
该死
Oh, shit.

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.040
没想到会这样
Didn't see that coming.

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:58.700
已经来不及了
Already short on time as it is.

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:00.450
放下枪
Drop it.

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.080
- 嘿 别开枪 - 我们得听他解释
- Whoa, hey. Don't shoot him. - We need to hear him out.

01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:06.790
你们想听他解释 边走边听吧
You want to hear him out? Let's do it on the move.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.330
走吧
Come on.

01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:15.990
我只想平静地度过余生 但格拉多夫找到了我
All I wanted to do was live my days out in peace, but Gradov found me,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.450
强行控制住我
put his claws into me,

01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:20.330
让我做我从来不想做的事
made me do things I never wanted to do.

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:23.040
但现在发生的事
But what's happening now,

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.500
我们正在做的事 已经太过了
what we've set into motion now, it's a bridge too far.

01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:30.990
我知道你们已经察觉
I know you've figured out there's an insider

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.250
政府最高层有他的内奸 但是我...
working at the highest levels of government. And, no, I...

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.620
我不知道...
I don't know...

01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:38.250
我不知道...
I don't know...

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.330
我不知道是谁
I don't know who the insider is.

01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:46.290
我从没见过他们 但他们帮格拉多夫进入了“梯队”
I never saw them face-to-face. But they helped Gradov get into Echelon,

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:48.660
帮他摧毁了空军一号
and they helped him take down Air Force One.

01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:50.740
我们怎么查出这个内奸是谁
Then how do we find out who this insider is?

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.790
通过格拉多夫的安全通讯
Through Gradov's secure communications.

01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:55.290
我设计的通讯
Communications I designed.

01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:59.120
但你们必须马上下车
But you'll have to get off this train right now.

01:09:59.450 --> 01:10:00.620
车还在开呢
While it's moving?

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:03.950
格拉多夫现在拥有上帝视角
Gradov's got the eyes of God at his disposal.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.080
他会派一队人在下一站等着杀了你们
They'll have a team waiting at the next station to kill you.

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:09.660
- 真棒啊 - 真棒啊
- Great. - Great.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.120
听着 我在克罗地亚有个据点
Look, there's a building in Croatia

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.160
那时我还不认识格拉多夫
I operated out of before I ever knew the name Gradov.

01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:20.200
去扎达尔的拉瓦斯卡街12号
Get to 12 Lavaska Street in Zadar.

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:24.620
五楼有个加密终端站
There's a secure terminal there on the fifth floor.

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.700
把手给我
Give me your hand.

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:29.540
好了

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:33.240
这个指令能运行我设计的一个程序
This prompt will run a program I designed

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:40.120
定位所有涉密许可持有者 与其通讯轨迹
to trace communications he had with anyone carrying compartmented security clearance.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.500
运行这个程序
Run the program,

01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:44.080
你就能找到内奸
you'll find the insider.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.080
你们必须结束这一切
You have to end this.

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:50.450
格拉多夫胃口太大
Gradov is insatiable.

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:52.660
他永远不会停手的
He'll never stop.

01:10:56.410 --> 01:11:00.580
做点好事改变一下感觉真好
Feels nice to do something good for a change.

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:11.000
该死 好吧
Shit. Okay.

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.540
好吧
Okay.

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:15.410
你知道吗 我们能搞定的 好吗
You know what? We got this, okay?

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:17.700
《亡命跳跃》里 我可是从货运列车上跳下去的
Hell, I barrel-rolled off a freight train in Death Jumpers.

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.120
你没跳 是你的替身跳的
No, you didn't. Your stuntman did.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.120
你非得这时候跟我抠字眼
Now? Now you want to bust me on a technicality?

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.740
先生 恕我直言 没人能从这列火车上跳下去
Sir, respectfully, no one is barrel-rolling off of this train.

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:26.700
是时候露头了 我们得打电话求助
I think it's time to raise your heads. We have to call someone.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.410
不行 我们得假定 所有高官都已被渗透
No, no, no. We have to assume that all high command posts are compromised.

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:32.330
没错 如果我们现在露面 内奸就会开始演戏
Yes, and if we resurface now, the cover-up begins,

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:35.290
我们永远无法知道内奸是谁 他们又能逍遥法外了
we never find out who's behind this, and they get to fight another day.

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:37.790
所以你宁愿 跳下时速65公里的火车吗
So you'd rather jump off a train that's going 40 miles an hour?

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:39.870
我们被动挨打已经太久了
We've been taking this on the chin for way too long,

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:42.330
我受够了一直防守
and I'm done with being on the defensive!

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:44.580
得了吧
Oh! Come on!

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.660
好吧 嘿
All right, hey!

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:48.830
记得把下巴缩到胸前
Just tuck your chin to your chest!

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:51.160
- 你确定有用吗  - 相信我
- Sure that's gonna make a difference? - Trust me!

01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:56.040
我觉得他没事
I think he's okay.

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:57.620
真是见鬼了
Damn you.

01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:04.200
雄起 德林杰
Man up, Derringer.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.990
你可是美国总统
You're the President of the United States.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.790
星条旗万岁
Stars and stripes forever!

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.000
团身缓冲

01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:15.160
在中情局我们有个说法
At the CIA, we had a saying:

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.410
“组织之力 源于个人
"The strength of the organization is the individual.

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:21.910
“个人之力 成于组织”
The strength of the individual is the organization."

01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:25.830
在座的各位 正是这一精神的鲜活体现
The collective that sits in this room is the living embodiment of that.

01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:29.370
而某些人正企图操纵我们
And someone out there is manipulating us.

01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:31.200
分裂我们
Trying to tear us apart.

01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:34.740
所以让我们向幕后黑手传递一个信号
So let's send whoever's behind this a message.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.370
一致向外
Swing in the other direction.

01:12:36.370 --> 01:12:38.000
加倍投入北约
Double down on NATO.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.330
让他们明白 任何破坏这一联盟的企图
Let it be known that if you try and break this bond,

01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:43.700
只会让我们更强大
it will only make us stronger.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.410
这些感性的话挺可爱的
Those are lovely sentiments.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.410
但你说的这些得建立在信任之上
But what you're asking for is predicated on trust.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.500
我不信任这房间里的任何人
And I don't trust anyone in this room.

01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:56.330
- 总理 - 没关系
- Chancellor... - It's fine.

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:57.330
让他走
Let him walk.

01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:59.540
现在是他的竞选季 他很害怕
He's in a campaign season. He's scared.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.910
猜猜下一届竞选我要主打什么
You know what I'm going to campaign on in the next cycle?

01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:05.870
退出这个联盟
Withdrawing from this alliance.

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:10.500
没关系
It's okay.

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.410
我们可以一起撑下去
We can hold this together.

01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:15.330
美国将承担他们的那部分费用
The U.S. will cover the cost of their contribution.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.410
这正是我们所需要的 不是吗
That's what we all need, isn't it?

01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:21.040
我想是的
I think so.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.000
美式傲慢又一次 被强塞进我们的喉咙
More American arrogance shoved down our throats.

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:27.700
明天早上将进行投票
There will be a vote held in the morning

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:32.330
25个国家已经同意解散北约 包括意大利
with 25 countries already on board to disband NATO, including Italy.

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:35.000
到时见 总统女士
I'll see you there, Madam President.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.830
缩下巴还挺管用的吧
Man, the chin thing kind of worked, huh?

01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:43.990
好了 可别再提下巴了
All right, enough with the bloody chin thing.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.870
你下巴没事多亏了我的妙招好吧
You don't have a bloody chin thanks to my killer pro tip.

01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:50.620
干得好 兄弟 你惹她生气了
Way to go, bro. You made her mad.

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:09.910
多谢
Thanks.

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:13.790
天啊 哈蒙德选藏身地的品味真差啊
Geez, Hammond didn't have an incredibly sexy taste in hideouts, huh?

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:16.200
有些人就喜欢躲在废弃的旧建筑里
Well, some people like to hide out in old derelict buildings,

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.990
就像有些人喜欢吸羊奶头一样
and others like to suck on sheep nipples.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.540
- 谁吸羊奶头了  - 没谁
- Who sucks on sheep nipples? - Nobody sucks on sheep nipples!

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.370
好吧 天啊 老天爷
Okay. God. Geez.

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.080
- 几楼  - 五楼
- What floor? - Fifth.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.000
好吧
All right.

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.410
快点 健身房强者
Come on, Gym Strong.

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:42.910
这里什么都没有
There's nothing here.

01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:45.080
那个该死的王八蛋骗子
Hammond, that lying son of a bitch.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.620
把我们骗进了死胡同
Led us to a dead end.

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:48.790
等等...
Unless...

01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:53.790
他没骗我们
...he didn't.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:11.080
太好了
Well, nice.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.330
好极了
Okay.

01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:13.450
你听到了吗
Do you hear that?

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.370
感觉来者不善啊
That does not look like the cavalry!

01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:33.830
把自己锁在安全屋里 我来处理
Lock yourselves in the safe room. I'm gonna go handle this.

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:37.200
只有你能从服务器上找到情报 我来拖住他们
No, no, no. You're the only one that can get the intel off the server. I'll hold them off.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.120
萨姆
Sam...

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.450
- 你觉得我退步了吗  - 你确实退步了
- What, do you think I've lost a step? - I know you've lost a step.

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:43.200
- 我只是不希望你死在我面前 - 快去吧
- I just don't want you dying on my watch. - Just go.

01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:44.870
我们能搞定的
We got this.

01:15:46.450 --> 01:15:48.620
你跟我来 我需要你的手
You're coming with me. I need your hand.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.500
我中枪了
I've been shot!

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:21.080
你没事吧
You okay?

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.160
没事
Yep!

01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:27.750
手
Hand.

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.160
好了
Okay.

01:16:51.410 --> 01:16:52.410
不妙
Oh, shit.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.540
- 他没事吧  - 拖住他们了 但我们得走了
- Is he okay? - Yeah, he's holding them off, but we need to go.

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.660
快点快点
Come on, come on, come on.

01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:41.160
好了 进去了
Okay, we're in.

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:43.620
行动中止
Abort!

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.040
撤退
Fall back!

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500
- 我找到内奸了 - 是的 是昆西
- I got the insider. - Yeah, it's Quincy.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:52.950
是布拉德肖
It's Bradshaw.

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:55.250
胡说
Bullshit.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.490
证据呢 给我看看
Tell me where it says that.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.830
她和格拉多夫18个月前就开始联系了
There are dozens of communications between her and Gradov going back almost 18 months.

01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:03.200
这里全是她留下的电子痕迹
Her digital fingerprints are all over this.

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:05.660
- 对不起 - 你不需要道歉
- I'm sorry. - You don't need to be sorry.

01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:09.330
等我抓到她 我会毁了她的世界
I'm gonna grind up her world when I get my hands on...

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.080
卡住了
It's stuck.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.160
- 你还好吗  - 没事
- You okay?! - Yes!

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.120
好的
Okay!

01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:19.700
萨姆
Sam.

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.910
不

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.160
我们得从这盒子里出去
We need to get out of this box.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.500
我需要你过来 快
I need you over here! Now!

01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:51.250
- 看到那个屋顶了吗  - 看到了
- You see that roof? - Yeah.

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:53.290
尽量低一点 好吗
Get as low as you can, okay?

01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:02.370
准备好
Get ready.

01:20:05.290 --> 01:20:06.330
跳
Drop!

01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:48.830
已经处理好了
It's handled.

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:09.500
她付了你额外的钱 让你收拾残局 对吧
She paid you extra to clean up loose ends, didn't she?

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:15.500
现在我就是残局
And now I'm the loose end.

01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:10.330
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.870
我知道他对你有多重要
I know how much he meant to you.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.080
我们之间的不完美如此美好
We had this... perfectly imperfect thing...

01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:26.540
时间磨不淡 距离冲不散
...that didn't fade with time or distance.

01:22:29.290 --> 01:22:33.200
知道有人爱你的一切
Knowing that someone loves everything about the way you are.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.410
好吧 除了我的双关笑话
Well, except the puns.

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.160
萨姆讨厌双关
Sam hated those puns.

01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:41.200
是啊
Yeah.

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:45.120
你知道吗 有那么一瞬间
You know, for a second there,

01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:47.990
我以为老天搞出这些破事
I thought that the universe did all this shit,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.660
这些糟心烂事
all this horrible shit,

01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:53.660
全是为了把我俩重新凑一块儿
just to bring us back together.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.370
我还很开心来着
And I was happy.

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.120
挺疯狂的 对吧
Pretty demented, huh?

01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:09.910
刚发现我最好的朋友想杀了我
I just found out my best friend tried to kill me

01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:12.870
还想彻底搞垮西方民主
and wants to rip the heart out of Western democracy,

01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:16.080
所以现在有什么想法都算不上疯狂
so everything's being graded on a curve today.

01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:20.870
是啊
Yeah.

01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:27.410
随着决定北约命运的投票 30分钟后即将举行
...with a vote on the future of NATO set 30 minutes from now

01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:30.790
各国领导人纷纷公开宣泄对盟友的
and with world leaders openly expressing their outrage

01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:32.370
愤慨与怒火
and anger at their allies and friends,

01:23:32.370 --> 01:23:38.250
这个历经75载的军事同盟 此刻似乎已站在了解体的悬崖边缘
it seems imminent that after 75 years, NATO is on the verge of collapse.

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:40.450
喂
Yes?

01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:41.700
总统女士
Madam President.

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.330
谢谢你暂代我的职位
Thanks for keeping my seat warm.

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:45.870
威廉 你是怎么...
Will? How did you...

01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:47.120
我马上就到
I'm coming in.

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.330
告诉我你需要什么
Tell me what you need.

01:23:48.330 --> 01:23:50.370
我在得里雅斯特港
I'm at the Port of Trieste.

01:23:50.370 --> 01:23:51.330
让“野兽”来接我
Send the Beast.

01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:53.410
对了 科克 布拉德肖是内奸
Oh, and, Kirk, Bradshaw's behind this,

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:55.830
别让她知道
so box her out.

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:57.040
好的
O-Okay.

01:23:57.750 --> 01:24:02.870
我会尽量拖延北约的投票 请务必安全到达
Um, I-I'll hold off the NATO vote as long as I can, and-and just get here safe.

01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:16.620
总统先生
Mr. President.

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:19.450
见到你可太好了
You sure are a sight for sore eyes.

01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:21.120
你先请
After you.

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.040
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:40.040
感谢各位 会议将于十分钟后开始
Thank you, everybody. The meeting will commence in 30 minutes.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.910
带他们去集合点 做好你的工作
Take them to the rally point and do your job.

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.830
别再让我失望了
Don't disappoint me again.

01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:50.790
不是布拉德肖
It wasn't Bradshaw.

01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:52.410
是科克
It's Kirk.

01:24:52.410 --> 01:24:55.450
当然是副总统 总是副总统
Of course it was the vice president. It's always the vice president.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.250
科克抓到他们了
Kirk has them.

01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:05.910
别让他们到达北约会议现场
Don't let them get to NATO.

01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.950
但布拉德肖确实在和格拉多夫联系
But Bradshaw's communications were tied to Gradov.

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:10.290
布拉德肖是个诱饵
Bradshaw was the decoy.

01:25:10.290 --> 01:25:11.990
科克掩盖了自己的电子足迹
Kirk covered her tracks.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.450
这叫应急方案
It's called contingencies.

01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:15.370
你有你的应急方案
You have your contingencies,

01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:17.250
我有我的
I have mine.

01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:45.620
有人追来了
We got company!

01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:51.500
开枪打他
Shoot him!

01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:53.540
开枪
Take the shot!

01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:03.870
该死 完了
Oh, sh-shit.

01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:05.200
- 去开车  - 好的
- Take the wheel! - Okay!

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.040
好耶
Yeah!

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.290
萨姆
- Sam? - Sam?

01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:44.120
稳住车子
Hold her steady!

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.660
好的 没问题
Okay, no problem!

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.080
你怎么还活着
How are you alive?!

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.330
别激动
Easy.

01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:15.450
我只是保持冷静 继续前行
I just kept calm and carried on.

01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:17.540
去帮她 这里有我
Help her. I've got this.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:20.450
抱歉 伙计
Sorry, mate.

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:38.540
开门
Open the door!

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:44.910
很糟吗
Is it bad?

01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:52.950
- 我们要去哪  - 我来了
- Where are we going? - I got you.

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.410
别第三次死在我面前好吗
Don't go dying on me a third time, okay?

01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:01.080
我腿上有把刀
Oh, there's a knife in my leg!

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:10.080
等等 也许我们不该把它拔出来
No, wait, wait. Maybe we should leave it in.

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.330
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.620
- 也没那么糟 - 很好
- Wasn't that bad. - Good. Okay.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:25.830
萨姆
Sam?

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:27.950
踩油门
Punch it!

01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:44.330
趴下
Get down!

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.000
我在盲开
I'm driving blind here!

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.410
这里 卫星地图
Here! Sat view!

01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:02.580
很好
Nice.

01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:08.290
这辆蝙蝠车里还有其他玩具吗
Any other toys in this Batmobile?

01:29:14.290 --> 01:29:15.410
烟雾
Smoke!

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.580
- 转 快转  - 这就转
- Turn. Turn. Turn. Turn! - I will. I will. I will.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:45.910
冰箱
The fridge!

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.750
什么 要用零食干掉他们
What, are you gonna kill them with snacks?

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.370
备用血液
Backup blood supply.

01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:55.250
接好了 该死的王八蛋
Take this, you bloody bastards!

01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:13.620
是“野兽”
That's the Beast. It's the Beast!

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:17.410
他有火箭筒
He's got a rocket launcher!

01:30:17.410 --> 01:30:18.660
萨姆 敌袭
Sam, incoming!

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:51.540
你已到达目的地
You have now reached your destination.

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.660
从今晚午夜起
Effective midnight tonight,

01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:59.120
意大利将正式退出北约
Italy will be withdrawing from the NATO alliance.

01:31:00.370 --> 01:31:03.040
我们也代表法兰西共和国
On behalf of the Republic of France,

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:04.950
正式退出
we withdraw as well.

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:10.540
我怀着沉痛的心情宣布 尽管我已为维系此联盟付出
It's with a heavy heart, despite my most strident efforts

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:12.490
不遗余力的努力
to hold this alliance together,

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.540
我代表美利坚合众国
on behalf of the United States,

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:16.450
宣布退...
I withdraw our...

01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:18.330
打住
Hold it right there!

01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:25.620
我代表英国...
On behalf of the United Kingdom...

01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:27.240
和美国...
And the United States of America.

01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:29.450
大家别情绪上头
...take it all down several notches, everyone.

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:30.410
没错
That's right.

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:33.040
我们可没那么容易被干掉
You're not getting rid of us that easy.

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.790
这个联盟也休想说散就散
And we're not getting rid of this alliance that easy,

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:38.790
因为我们都有自己的职责
because we all have a job to do.

01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:39.790
我明白
I get it.

01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:42.080
你们很羞愤 你们很愤慨
You're embarrassed. You're angry.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:45.660
但我们需要北约 我们需要合作
But we need NATO. We need partnerships.

01:31:47.290 --> 01:31:49.490
我们需要尊重彼此
We need to treat each other with respect,

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.490
拥抱差异
embrace each other's differences

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:54.120
寻求大同
and lean into our commonalities.

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:58.490
向子孙后代传递一个信息 那就是我们在这里
To send a message to future generations that we were here.

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.040
我们做了正确的事
That we did the right thing.

01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:03.500
首先要做的就是
And that starts by taking the fight

01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:06.160
向真正的敌人宣战
to the very real enemies we face.

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.160
够了
There it is.

01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:10.370
这就是必然的结局
The inevitable conclusion.

01:32:11.370 --> 01:32:14.620
人民选出了个蠢演员 来当自由世界的领袖
The people elect a dopey actor as leader of the free world.

01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:16.750
这样他们的国家怎么可能存活呢
Of course their country can't survive.

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:19.410
你就这样轻易达成协议了
And you just sealed the deal.

01:32:19.410 --> 01:32:21.410
这些人是我们的伙伴 我们需要他们
These people are our partners, and we need them.

01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:22.490
需要他们做什么
For what?

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:25.410
我们自己种植食物 抽取石油 生产制造
We grow food. We pump oil. We manufacture.

01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:30.750
同时 我们还得派人去帮他们打仗
Meanwhile, we send our people to die in their wars.

01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:33.700
这不是合作关系
This is not a partnership.

01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:35.910
我们付出 他们只会坐享其成
We give, they take.

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:37.950
但现在不是了
But not anymore.

01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:41.330
航班即将坠毁
The plane is going down.

01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:44.870
我们得先给自己戴上氧气面罩
We put the oxygen masks on ourselves first.

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.160
- 反正这些都是虚假的联盟 - 虚假的联盟
- These are all false alliances anyway. - False alliances?

01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:50.660

是的 都是些关于内阁任命的小闲聊
And yes, there's some light chitchat about a cabinet appointment.

没什么大不了的
No big deal.

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.200
